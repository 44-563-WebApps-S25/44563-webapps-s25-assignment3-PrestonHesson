    <h1>Preston Hesson</h1>

    <h2>Favorite Movie: The Matrix</h2>
    <p>My favorite movie is <strong>The Matrix</strong> because it challenges the idea of reality and explores deep philosophical themes. The action scenes are iconic, and the storyline is mind-bending. I love how it makes you think about the world around you.</p>

    <h3>Suggested Actors for the Role of Neo</h3>
    <p>Here are some actors I think could have been an interesting choice to play the role of Neo in *The Matrix*. Each of these actors brings something unique to the table, and I believe they could have delivered a compelling performance as the iconic character.</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Keanu Reeves</td>
                <td>Keanu's portrayal is iconic, but I'd love to see him as a younger version of Neo.</td>
                <td>60</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tom Hardy</td>
                <td>Hardy is known for his intense and transformative roles, perfect for Neo.</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Scarlett Johansson</td>
                <td>Johansson could bring a fresh perspective to Neo, showing a different side of the character.</td>
                <td>40</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Idris Elba</td>
                <td>Elba has the gravitas and physicality to take on a role like Neo.</td>
                <td>51</td>
            </tr>
